Program: PatternTool

Purpose: An editor which provides visual aid of the bullet patterns for bullet hell games 
             that the user can create as well as edit to their needs and wants.
           
Instructions: Under the Initialization() section of the code, there will be box out section
                  that has the header comment "List of variables that can be edited".
              
                  There, it will list out the variables that has a direct impact on the resulting pattern
                  and a comment explaining what each variable affects as well as their default value.
                
                  The tool works so that the user will run the tool to see what the default pattern is, 
                  then make changes to the variable then preview it and repeat the process to create a pattern to better suit their needs.
 	
	     There is also the option of using the in-tool options to edit the pattern live.
                 
                  After booting up, the left and right arrow keys can be used to decide which pattern the user wants to preview and edit.
                 
                  Once a pattern has been decided to preview, the pattern is editable by using the top two rows of the alphabets keys on the keyboard starting from the left.
                 
                  The first variable editable will use the combination of Q and A, and the second using the combination W and S, followed in that pattern.
                 
                  Then after the user has decided on a pattern to save, the enter key can be pressed to save those settings.

	     The saved settings file can be found at the directory: PatternTool\PatternTool\bin\DesktopGL\AnyCPU\Debug\settings.ini
